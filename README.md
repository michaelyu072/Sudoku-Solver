# Sudoku-Solver
This is my first personal coding project in Python, I followed the tutorial made by Tech With Tim on Youtube 

This program requires Pygame to run

When you run the program, an unsolved Sudoku board will appear in a display window. You can press ENTER to see the brute-force, recursive back-tracking algorithm solve the board.

#This program taught me basic python syntax, object-oriented programming, and recursion
